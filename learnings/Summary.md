## Answer Key

1. **The transformers library** is used to load and utilize pre-trained models, specifically for the zero-shot classification pipeline used for theme classification.

2. **The sent_tokenize function** is used to split the entire script text into individual sentences, which are then processed in batches by the theme classifier.

3. **The specific pre-trained model** being loaded is "facebook/bart-large-mnli".

4. **The theme classifier pipeline** is initialized using `pipeline("zero-shot-classification", model=model_name, device=device)`, specifying the task, the model to use, and the computing device.

5. **The theme_list variable** contains the list of potential themes that the zero-shot classification model will evaluate for each sentence or batch of sentences.

6. **Subtitle files** are located using glob to find all .ass files in a specified directory. These files are then read line by line, processed to extract the script, and consolidated into a pandas DataFrame with episode numbers and scripts.

7. **The raw text** is processed by skipping initial lines (assuming they are metadata), joining the relevant parts of each line, and replacing newline characters (\\N) with spaces to create a clean script string.

8. **Script batches** are created by iterating through the list of sentences and grouping a fixed number of sentences (defined by sentence_batch_size) together into single strings.

9. **The theme inference results**, which are a list of dictionaries containing labels and scores for each batch, are wrangled by iterating through the results, extracting the scores for each theme, and storing them in a dictionary where keys are themes and values are lists of scores. These scores are then averaged.

10. **The final DataFrame df** contains the episode number, the full script for that episode, and new columns representing the average scores for each theme in the theme_list for that episode's script.

## Essay Format Questions

1. **Discuss the advantages and disadvantages** of using a zero-shot classification model for theme analysis compared to a model explicitly trained on a dataset of movie or TV show themes.

2. **Analyze the processing steps** applied to the .ass subtitle files and explain how each step contributes to preparing the data for the theme classification model.

3. **Evaluate the method of batching sentences** for theme classification. How might the sentence_batch_size affect the results, and what are potential alternative approaches to processing the script text?

4. **Examine the themes identified** in the theme_list. Based on the provided script excerpt (Episode 1 of Naruto), discuss whether the inferred themes and their scores align with the narrative content.

5. **Propose ways to extend** this theme classification process to analyze a larger dataset of subtitles. What challenges might arise, and how could the methodology be adapted to handle a greater volume of data and potentially different types of subtitle formats?

## Glossary of Key Terms

**transformers**: A Python library developed by Hugging Face that provides state-of-the-art machine learning models, particularly for natural language processing tasks.

**pipeline**: A high-level function from the transformers library that simplifies the use of pre-trained models for specific tasks, such as zero-shot classification.

**zero-shot classification**: A machine learning task where a model is trained to classify data into categories it has not seen during training. It uses a set of candidate labels provided at inference time.

**nltk**: The Natural Language Toolkit, a Python library for working with human language data. Used here for sentence tokenization.

**sent_tokenize**: A function from the nltk library that splits a text into a list of sentences.

**glob**: A module in Python that finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern. Used here to locate subtitle files.

**pandas**: A Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. Used here for creating and working with DataFrames.

**numpy**: A Python library for numerical computing. Used here for calculating the mean of theme scores.

**torch**: A Python library for tensor computation and deep learning. Used here to check for GPU availability.

**model_name**: A string variable specifying the name of the pre-trained model to be loaded from the transformers library.

**device**: A variable indicating the computing device (CPU or GPU) on which the model will be loaded and run.

**theme_classifier**: An instance of the pipeline configured for zero-shot classification with the specified model.

**theme_list**: A list of strings representing the candidate themes the zero-shot classifier will evaluate for each input text.

**multi_label**: A parameter in the zero-shot classification pipeline that, when set to True, allows the model to assign multiple labels (themes) to a single input text.

**subtitle_dataset**: Refers to the collection of subtitle files being used as input for theme analysis.

**script**: The extracted text content from a subtitle file, representing the dialogue and narration of an episode.

**episode_num**: The numerical identifier for a specific episode.

**script_sentences**: A list containing the individual sentences extracted from the full script using sent_tokenize.

**sentence_batch_size**: The number of sentences grouped together to form a single batch for processing by the theme classifier.

**script_batches**: A list of strings, where each string is a concatenation of sentences forming a batch.

**theme_output**: The raw output generated by the theme classifier pipeline for the input batches. It typically includes the input sequence, the predicted labels (themes), and their corresponding scores.

**themes**: A dictionary used to store and aggregate the scores for each theme across multiple batches.

**get_themes_inference**: A function defined to encapsulate the process of taking a script, batching its sentences, running the theme classifier, and wrangling the output into a dictionary of average theme scores.

**output_themes**: A pandas Series resulting from applying the get_themes_inference function to the 'script' column of the DataFrame, where each element is a dictionary of theme scores for an episode.

**theme_df**: A pandas DataFrame created from the output_themes Series, with columns representing the themes and values representing the average theme scores for each episode.
