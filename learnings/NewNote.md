Automated Subtitle Theme Classification â€“ Key Notes
1. What is the primary function of the transformers library in this process?

The transformers library is essential for leveraging powerful pre-trained machine learning models. Here, its primary function is to load and utilize a specific pre-trained model, "facebook/bart-large-mnli", for zero-shot classification of subtitle themes.
2. How is subtitle data processed from raw .ass files into a usable script format?

The process involves:

    Locating files: Using glob to find all .ass files in a directory.
    Reading lines: Opening and reading each file line by line.
    Skipping metadata: Skipping initial lines presumed to be metadata.
    Extracting script content: Splitting each line by commas and joining parts from the ninth element onward.
    Cleaning text: Replacing newline characters (\N) with spaces.
    Consolidating: Storing cleaned scripts and episode numbers (from filenames) in a pandas DataFrame.

3. What is the role of sent_tokenize from the nltk library?

The sent_tokenize function splits the full script text of an episode into individual sentences. This is crucial because the zero-shot classification model processes text in smaller, manageable chunks.
4. What are "script batches" and why are they created?

    Script batches are groups of a fixed number of sentences combined into a single string.
    Purpose: To manage input size for the classifier. Instead of sending the entire script at once, it is processed in manageable batches.

5. How is the zero-shot-classification pipeline initialized and configured?

    Initialization: With the pipeline function from transformers.
    Configuration:
        Task: "zero-shot-classification"
        Model: "facebook/bart-large-mnli"
        Computing device: device=device (automatically uses GPU if available)
        Themes: theme_list (candidate themes) provided as input labels.

6. What is the purpose of the theme_list variable?

    theme_list contains strings representing potential themes (e.g., "friendship", "hope", "sacrifice").
    It serves as candidate labels for the classification model to detect within the subtitle scripts.

7. How are theme inference results processed to calculate average scores per episode?

    Model outputs a list of dictionaries for each batch, each with predicted labels (themes) and scores.
    Steps:
        Use a dictionary to accumulate theme scores for each batch in an episode.
        For each batch, append scores to the corresponding theme's list.
        After processing all batches, calculate the average score for each theme.

8. What does the final pandas DataFrame (df) contain after classification?

For each subtitle file (episode), the DataFrame contains:

    episode: Episode number.
    script: Full, cleaned script text.
    Theme columns: Each column corresponds to a theme in theme_list and contains the average score for that theme.

This allows for a quantitative assessment of thematic presence per episode.
